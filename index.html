I want player to experience a little bit of suspense. Maybe some frustration.
</li>

This game is a platform shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use a and d to move, w to jump, and click to shoot. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I'm just trying to figure out how to use GitHub and Phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features a sort-of unique story. The gameplay is pretty basic, though.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a dead cat that is trying to escape from the land of the dead.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a dead cat. Since your death 40 years ago, your soul had no existance for
souls can only exist in the memories of the living. In other words, you died alone
and forgotten. However, you suddenly find yourself in the land of the dead, where
the souls of the remembered roam. Who possibly could have you in their memory? 
Unfortunately, cats aren't supposed to be in the land of the dead, for unknown reasons. 
The ghostly guards want you out and you agree with them. You want to find whoever
has remembered you, and your only chance is to visit the land of the living.
Luckily, there's a portal nearby for you to escape in!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People into dark, story-heavy indie games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
About two minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It is best if the player uses an actual mouse rather than a touch pad!
Also, watch how you jump because you can't control how you fall.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Player Sprite made from scratch.
